My AI is focused on NEAT - Neuro Evolutions of Augmented Typology, where the optimal structure is the main goal, second is the weight distribution.
I have finished about 85 % of the code to make this work, however every part is a piece of the puzzle, and there for it is not possible to have a 'demo'
In the scene included there is a small introduction to a demo, where I have the cube in the middle try to match itself with the cube around ( color )
However since the topics: Selection, Cross Over, Probability and Diversity, are not finished there is no visual evolution, and the network is just adding
Connections and Nodes without any purpose or verification that these nodes are effective.

The code is quite well documented and should give a clear example that I understand the topic of my AI-research.

I have a Github for this project, and in case you are interested in following the development, or want to check out the progress; https://github.com/ToastyStoemp/GeneticSnake
